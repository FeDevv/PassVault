# 📁 PassVault - Java Password Manager
**PassVault** is a simple password manager written in Java, designed to securely store user account credentials using AES-128 encryption and a master password required once per session.

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Store accounts with platform, username, email, and password
- 🔒 AES encryption for passwords (with random IV and salt per encryption)
- 🧠 Master password required only once per session
- 🔐 Secure credential verification
- ✏️ Update existing accounts
- ❌ Securely delete accounts
- 📂 Persistent local file-based storage
- Command-line interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java 17+
- IntelliJ IDEA
- AES with PBKDF2 (HmacSHA256) for key derivation
- Local file system for persistence

---

## 🗃️ Project Structure
- Main.java – Entry point and text-based user interface
- Account.java – Represents a user account
- AccountDAO.java – Interface for CRUD operations
- AccountFileDAO.java – DAO implementation using file storage
- CryptoUtils.java – AES encryption/decryption logic
- SessionManager.java – Handles the master password for the session
- accounts.txt – Stores account data (with encrypted passwords)

---

## 🔐 Security Design
- Passwords are never stored in plain text.
- Every encryption generates a unique IV and salt.
- The master password is never saved; it is used only to derive the encryption key at runtime.
- All error messages are intentionally generic to avoid leaking sensitive information (e.g., "account not found" instead of "wrong password").

---

## ⚠️ File Format Limitation

The application uses a semicolon (`;`) as a delimiter to separate account fields (platform, username, email, encrypted password) when saving data to the file.

**Important:**  
Do **not** use semicolons (`;`) in any of the following fields:

- Platform  
- Username  
- Email  
- Password  

Using `;` will break file parsing and may cause data corruption or application errors.
